I am a full stack web developer with experience in accounting and customer service. I have obtained a certificate from University of Toronto full stack web developer course and a bachelor of commerce degree from the same institution. With self taught coding skills and expanded skills and knowledge in JavaScript ES6+, CSS3, HTML5, React, MongoDB, Bootstrap, JQuery, Node.js, Express.js, handlebars.js, Git, Heroku, MySQL and RESTful APIs. My previous experience has provided me with strong organization, time management and oral/written communication skills, as well as attention to detail. In addition to the ability to self start, research solutions and work independently. 

I have built full stack applications using the MERN stack as well as alternatives tech stacks that include MySQL, Express and handlebars. I have developed backend and frontend applications that leveraged third party API and test driven development using Jest. I have worked in teams employing agile methodologies as well.

I am continuously learning and I'm excited to develop more skills with useful tools and technologies in order to continue my journey building on the web.
