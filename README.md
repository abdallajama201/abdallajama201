I am a full stack web developer with experience in accounting and customer service. I have built full stack applications using the MERN stack as well as alternatives tech stacks that include MySQL, Express and handlebars. I have developed backend and frontend applications that leveraged third party API and test driven development using Jest. I have worked in teams employing agile methodologies as well. I have obtained a certificate from University of Toronto full stack web developer course and a bachelor of commerce degree from the same institution. 

I am continuously learning and I'm excited to develop more skills with useful tools and technologies in order to continue my journey building on the web.
